It is estimated that the rice production must increase by 114 million tons by \\n2035, but farmers must achieve it under significant threats from climate change \\n(Suzanne et\\xa0al. 2012) coupled with decreasing amount of available agricultural land, \\nlabor, and water for agriculture and increased costs of all inputs. Increasing global \\nfood production with minimal adverse impact on resources and the environment is \\nthe greatest challenge for food security (Ladha et\\xa0al. 2015). Hence, for ensuring \\nfood and nutritional security of the rice-growing world, it is essential to make con-\\nsistent efforts to understand and develop innovative rice production systems that are \\nresource use efficient, higher net income generating, and environment friendly.\\nThis chapter attempts to summarize the information on rice production systems, \\nresources used, crop productivity attained, the challenges encountered, and possible \\nresearch needs for improving productivity in rice production systems, to meet the \\nfuture food demands.\\nA.N.

Globally rice is grown on a total area of approximately 158 \\nmillion ha, producing more than 700 million tons annually (470.6 million tons of \\nmilled rice) in 2015 (USDA 2016). About 90\\xa0% (nearly 640 million tons) of the rice \\nin the world is grown in Asia (Fig. 8.1), with China and India as the lead producers. \\nAfrica and Latin America produce about 25 million tons each. In Asia and sub-\\xad\\nSaharan Africa, almost all rice is grown on small farms of 0.5–3\\xa0ha per household. \\nRice is produced in many different environments and in many ways. The rice pro-\\nduction systems were classified by different scientists, in different countries, and in \\ndifferent ways at different times, depending on the context. The environmental and \\nsocioeconomic conditions of rice production vary greatly from country to country \\nas well as from location to location which affected the performance of rice produc-\\ntion in the past and influences the potential of improving future rice production. \\nRice is cultivated under temperate, subtropical, and tropical climatic conditions \\nwith the weather varying from arid and semiarid to subhumid and humid. Based on \\nsoil water conditions, rice production ecosystems include irrigated lowland, irri-\\ngated upland, rainfed lowland, rainfed upland, and deep water/floating ecosystems \\n(Fig. 8.2). Socioeconomically, farm size cultivated by a household in South Asia, \\nSoutheast Asia, East Asia, and Africa is generally small, which varies from less than \\n1\\xa0ha to few hectares. In the developed countries, the farm size is larger.\\n8.2.1\\u2003 \\x07Classification of\\xa0Rice Production Systems Based \\non\\xa0the\\xa0Environment Where the\\xa0Rice Is Grown\\nThe classifications of rice environments are based on altitude (upland, lowland, \\ndeep water) and water source (irrigated or rainfed).\\nEast Asia\\n33%\\nSouth Asia\\n31%\\nLatin\\nAmerica\\n4%\\nAfrica\\n3%\\nOther\\n2%\\nSoutheast\\nAsia\\n27%\\nFig. 8.1\\u2002 Percent of global  \\nrice production by region. \\n2011 (www.irri.org)\\nA.N. Rao et al.\\n187\\n\\t1.\\t Lowland rice production system\\xa0– Continuously grown under flooding (paddy \\nrice). Lowlands are further categorized as:\\n\\t(i)\\t Irrigated lowland production system: Irrigated lowland rice system produces \\n75\\xa0% of the global rice production from about 93 million ha. Asia has around \\n56\\xa0% of the world’s all crops in total irrigated area, of which 40–46\\xa0% is of rice. \\nRice occupies 64–83\\xa0%, 46–52\\xa0%, and 30–35\\xa0% of the irrigated area in Southeast \\nAsia, East Asia, and South Asia, respectively (GRiSP, 2013). The countries \\nwith the largest areas of irrigated lowland rice are China (31\\xa0 M\\xa0 ha), India \\n(19\\xa0M\\xa0ha), Indonesia (7\\xa0M\\xa0ha), and Vietnam (3\\xa0M\\xa0ha) (Dobermann and Fairhurst \\n2000). Irrigated lowland rice production system is the most important rice pro-\\nduction system for food security of Asian countries. The most common method \\nof establishment of this production system is transplanting. Rice is also estab-\\nlished by direct wet or water seeding in irrigated lowland production systems. \\nIn transplanting method of rice establishment, rice seedlings are raised in a rice \\nseedling nursery for 20–40\\xa0days prior to their manual or mechanical transplant-\\ning into the flooded field. Irrigated rice is grown in bunded fields or paddies, \\nwhich are surrounded by a small levee that keeps the water surrounded. The \\nfarmers, who have small holding (0.5 to 2 acres) of land, normally maintain in \\nthe field a water layer of 5–10 centimeters (cm) during the major period of the \\ncropping cycle (Bouman et\\xa0al. 2006). One or more rice crops can be grown per \\nyear as the water supply is assured. Rice–rice and rice-upland cropping systems \\nare followed. Irrigated rice receives about 40\\xa0% of the world’s irrigation water \\nFig. 8.2\\u2002 Major global rice-growing areas and ecosystems (GRiSP 2013)\\n8\\u2003 Rice Production Systems\\n188\\nand 30\\xa0% of the world’s developed freshwater resources. The average produc-\\ntivity of irrigated lowland rice is higher (about 5.4\\xa0t/ha) (GRiSP 2013).\\nRice is grown under irrigated systems in temperate climatic conditions of \\nAustralia, Bhutan, Central Asia (Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan), Chile, China, \\nJapan, Korea, Nepal, Russia, Turkey, the USA, and Uruguay (Jena and Hardy \\n2012). In Bhutan, Nepal, and part of China, rice is established by transplant-\\ning. In the irrigated lowlands of Korea, rice is mostly established by machine \\ntransplanting method with hand transplanting practiced on only 1.2\\xa0% of mar-\\nginal rice land. However, with decreased labor availability and rising labor \\ncost, farmers are motivated to shift from transplanting to direct seeding as is \\npracticed in other temperate rice-growing countries. In temperate climatic \\nregions where a single irrigated rice crop is grown per year, productivity of \\n8–10\\xa0\\nt/ha \\nor \\nmore \\nis \\nachieved \\n(http://ricepedia.org/rice-as-a-crop/\\nwhere-is-rice-grown).\\n\\t(ii)\\t Rainfed lowland production system (including flood prone): Rainfed lowland \\nrice is grown in river deltas and coastal areas of South Asia, parts of Southeast \\nAsia, and essentially all of Africa, where the fields are bunded and flooded with \\nrainwater for at least a part of the cropping season. In this system, the major \\nmethod of rice establishment is transplanting, but direct wet or dry seeding is \\nalso practiced. Globally, around 19\\xa0% of the world’s rice is produced from 52 \\nmillion ha of rainfed lowlands (GRiSP 2013). Abiotic stresses, such as drought \\n(in around 27 million ha) and uncontrolled flooding ranging from short-\\xadduration \\nflash floods to deep water submergence with 100\\xa0cm of water for a few months \\n(20 million ha), prevail due to highly uncertain rainfall and salinity (Dobermann \\nand Fairhurst 2000; Bouman et\\xa0 al. 2005; Wassmann et\\xa0 al. 2009; Clermont-\\xad\\nDauphin et\\xa0al. 2010; Mackill et\\xa0al. 2010). Water is 1 to 5\\xa0m deep and is supplied \\nby rivers, lakes, or tides in river mouth deltas. Water depth may exceed 5\\xa0m in \\nsome parts of Bangladesh, as well as in the Mekong, Kariba Dam (Tongas), and \\nNiger deltas. Deep water or floating rice is established by broadcasting rice \\nseed in plowed fields and is normally grown unbunded, in regions where the \\nwater level rises quickly after the beginning of the monsoon. Traditional long \\ntiller and few sprout varieties are cultivated. The rice plants elongate and float \\nas the floodwater advances; thus, it is named as “floating rice.” Due to the risk \\ninvolved in growing rice in these most difficult environments, farmers tend to \\nuse fertilizers rarely and avoid using improved rice varieties. Thus the rice pro-\\nductivity in rainfed lowland areas is very low (1–2.5\\xa0t/ha) (Dobermann and \\nFairhurst 2000).\\n\\t2.\\t Rainfed upland rice production system\\xa0– In this system the rice is grown under \\nhigh rainfall. Rainfed upland rice production system is often used by subsistence \\nfarmers in Asia, Africa, and Central America. It can be found in environments \\nranging from low-lying valley bottoms to steep sloping lands with high runoff. \\nThe rice in this system is established by broadcasting or dibbling in dry soil prior \\nto the onset of monsoon or during the rainy season. The aerobic condition pre-\\nvails in the soil throughout the rice cropping season. Traditionally, one rice crop \\nA.N. Rao et al.\\n189\\nis grown annually with minimal input application. Of rice produced in around 15 \\nmillion ha, rainfed uplands account for about 4\\xa0% of the global total rice produc-\\ntion (GRiSP 2013). Two-third of rainfed upland rice is in Asia (Bangladesh, \\nCambodia, China, India, Indonesia, Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam). In the \\nrice belt of Africa, upland areas of central and western part represent about 40\\xa0% \\nof the African area under rice cultivation and employ about 70\\xa0% of the region’s \\nrice farmers (Bouman et\\xa0al. 2007). The ecosystem is extremely diverse, includ-\\ning fields that are level, gently rolling, or steep, at altitudes of up to 2000\\xa0m and \\nwith rainfall ranging from 1000 to 4500\\xa0mm annually. Soils range from highly \\nfertile to highly weathered, infertile, and acidic, but only 15 % of total upland \\nrice grows where soils are fertile and the growing season is long. The productiv-\\nity of upland rainfed rice is low (about 1\\xa0t/ha) because of many biotic, abiotic, \\nand social constraints and the use of the local varieties by farmers that fail to \\nrespond to improved management practices. The major constraints of this sys-\\ntem are drought, problem soils, and pests (weeds, diseases, insects, nematodes) \\n(Bouman et\\xa0al. 2007; GRiSP 2013).\\n\\t3.\\t Irrigated upland or aerobic rice production system – In aerobic rice systems, the \\nrice plant is established by direct seeding in non-puddled, non-flooded fields and \\nmanaged intensively as an upland crop (Tuong and Bouman 2003). Aerobic rice \\nsystems can reduce water requirements for rice production by over 44\\xa0% relative \\nto conventionally transplanted systems, by reducing percolation, seepage, and \\nevaporation losses, while maintaining yields at an acceptable level (Bouman \\net\\xa0al. 2005). There were efforts in the 1980s to develop and popularize the irri-\\ngated upland rice or aerobic rice production in Brazil using sprinkler irrigation \\nsystems. In northern China, aerobic rice production is being practiced currently \\nat a limited scale in freely drained fields, as a response to water shortage. The \\nareas planted with aerobic rice varieties were estimated to be about 80,000\\xa0ha in \\nChina and 250,000\\xa0ha in Brazil (http://www.fao.org/agriculture /crops /thematic-\\xad\\nsitemap/ theme/spi/scpi-home/managing-ecosystems/sustainable-rice-systems/\\nrice-what/en/). In India, the aerobic rice system adoption has been initiated in \\nstates like Karnataka (Rao et\\xa0al. 2015).\\n8.2.2\\u2003 \\x07Classification of\\xa0Rice Production Systems Based \\non\\xa0the\\xa0Method of\\xa0Rice Establishment\\nThe major methods of rice establishment in the world are transplanting and direct \\nseeding. Thus, based on the method of rice establishment, the rice production sys-\\ntems may be categorized as (a) transplanted rice (TPR) production systems and (b) \\ndirect-seeded rice production systems. Direct-seeded rice production systems may \\nbe further categorized as (i) dry-seeded rice (dry-DSR) production system, (ii) wet-\\xad\\nseeded rice (wet-DSR) production system, and (iii) water-seeded rice (water-DSR) \\nproduction system. These production systems are briefly described below.\\n8\\u2003 Rice Production Systems\\n190\\n8.2.2.1\\u2003 \\x07Transplanted Rice (TPR) Production System\\nRice is commonly grown by transplanting seedlings into the puddled soil (wet till-\\nage) in lowlands of Asia (e.g., India, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Myanmar) and Africa \\n(e.g., Madagascar, Mali). Transplanting of rice is done manually (Fig. 8.3) or by \\nmachine (Fig. 8.4). The manual transplanting method involves growing of seedlings \\nin a nursery and replanting of 20–30-day-old rice seedlings to puddled soils. The rice \\nseedling nursery may be raised on wet bed or dry bed or dapog or mat or modified \\nmat methods depending on the locality, soil type, rice ecosystem, and the resource \\navailability (for details, refer to http://www.knowledgebank.irri.org/step-\\xadby-\\xadstep-\\nproduction/growth/planting). In several Asian countries, the labor-intensive trans-\\nplanted rice production systems are being practiced until now, where even the labor \\nsupply is abundant due to the population growth. For machine transplanting the rice \\nseedlings are grown in trays or in mat-type nursery in which a thin layer of sol mixed \\nwith farm yard manure or compost is placed on a polythene sheet and rice seedlings \\nare raised. Mats of rice seedlings from the trays or mat-type nursery are used for \\nmachine transplanting. In Asia, machine transplanters are now being used to estab-\\nlish rice crops in China, Japan, Korea, and Taiwan. In India, farmers started using it \\nin states like Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. The traditional TPR production system \\nFig. 8.3\\u2002 The manual transplanting method of rice establishment uses more labor, water, and \\nenergy as it involves processes such as rice seedling nursery raising, seedling pulling, and trans-\\nplanting in flooded soil conditions (Photos by A.N.\\xa0Rao)\\nA.N. Rao et al.\\n191\\nhas advantages such as adequate nutrient availability (e.g., phosphorus, zinc, iron) \\ndue to creation of anaerobic conditions (Sanchez 1973), assured seedling establish-\\nment, initial seedling vigor, and competitiveness against weeds (Rao et\\xa0al. 2007). \\nHowever, higher quantities of water are consumed in TPR in order to accomplish the \\nprocesses such as puddling, surface evaporation, and percolation (Farooq et\\xa0 al. \\n2011). This production system is labor, water, and energy intensive and is becoming \\nless profitable as these resources are becoming increasingly scarce. It also deterio-\\nrates the physical properties of soil, adversely affects the performance of succeeding \\nupland crops, and contributes to methane emissions. However, TPR continues to \\ndominate under certain environmental and socioeconomic conditions of the world.\\n8.2.2.2\\u2003 \\x07Direct-Seeded Rice (DSR) Production System\\nDirect seeding of rice is done by (1) dry seeding (dry-DSR), (2) wet seeding (wet-\\xad\\nDSR), and (3) water seeding (water-DSR) (Kumar and Ladha 2011). As the rice \\nseeds are sown directly, the dry- , wet- and water-DSR methods are often jointly \\nreferred to as DSR.\\xa0At present 23\\xa0% of rice area is direct-seeded globally (Rao et\\xa0al. \\nFig. 8.4\\u2002 Rice establishment by using transplanting machine reduces the drudgery of women labor, \\nreduces the cost of cultivation, and ensures optimum rice plant population (Photos by A.N.\\xa0Rao)\\n8\\u2003 Rice Production Systems\\n192\\n2007; Kumar and Ladha 2011). Dry-DSR consists of sowing dry seeds on dry \\n(unsaturated) soils. Seeds can be broadcasted, drilled, or dibbled. Dry-DSR produc-\\ntion is practiced traditionally in most of the Asian countries in rainfed upland eco-\\nsystems and is also used in irrigated areas with precise water control as aerobic rice. \\nIn certain states of India, farmers are cultivating dry-DSR with the onset of mon-\\nsoon and convert it to irrigated lowland rice after release of the assured canal water \\nin the system (Fig. 8.5) (Rao et\\xa0al. 2015). Dry-DSR and TPR in the furrow-irrigated \\nraised-bed planting system were also tested (Singh et\\xa0al. 2006, 2008) for attaining \\noptimal water productivity in the rice–wheat system in the Indo-Gangetic Plains of \\nSouth Asia. However, rice establishment on furrow-irrigated raised-beds is not cur-\\nrently popular among the rice farming community.\\nWet-DSR involves sowing of pre-germinated rice seeds in wet (saturated) pud-\\ndled soils. Wet- DSR is done by broadcasting the seeds on puddled soil or by using \\na drum seeder (Fig. 8.6). Wet-DSR is practiced in favorable rainfed lowlands and \\nirrigated area with good facility of drainage as in Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, the \\nPhilippines, and Sri Lanka (Pandey and Velasco 2005; Weerakoon et\\xa0al. 2011). DSR \\nis becoming an attractive alternative to TPR.\\xa0Asian rice farmers are shifting to DSR \\nto reduce labor input, drudgery, and cultivation cost (Rao et\\xa0al. 2007; Kumar and \\nLadha, 2011).The increased availability of short-duration rice varieties and cost-\\xad\\nefficient selective herbicides has encouraged farmers to try this method of establish-\\ning rice (Balasubramanian and Hill 2002). It is quickly replacing traditional \\nFig. 8.5\\u2002 Dry-seeded irrigated rice sown by using seed cum fertilizer drill (Photos by A.N.\\xa0Rao)\\nA.N. Rao et al.\\n193\\ntransplanting in areas with good drainage and water control (Balasubramanian and \\nHill 2002). Rice is mostly direct-seeded, with only 6\\xa0% area under transplanting, in \\nLatin America (GRiSP 2013). In the water-DSR, pre-germinated rice seeds (soaked \\nand incubated for 24\\xa0h each) are broadcast in standing water on puddled (wet-water-\\xad\\nDSR) or unpuddled soil (dry-water-DSR). The relatively heavyweight rice seeds \\nsink in standing water, resulting in good anchorage. Water-DSR is used for rice \\nestablishment in irrigated lowland areas with good land leveling as in California \\n(United States), Australia, and European countries specifically for managing prob-\\nlematic weeds such as weedy rice. In Asia, some countries like Malaysia are \\n\\xadadopting it.\\nIn this chapter, the method of rice establishment is considered as the major crite-\\nria for classifying rice production systems. The information of these rice production \\nsystems on the attained crop productivity, the resources used, and the challenges \\nencountered will be discussed while highlighting the possible research needs for \\nimproving productivity in rice production systems to meet the future food demands.\\n8.3\\u2003 \\x07Productivity of\\xa0Different Rice Production Systems\\nSeveral studies have shown that productivity of TPR and DSR rice will be similar in \\na given environment provided that they are cultivated using best management prac-\\ntices (Rickman et\\xa0 al. 2001; Mitchell et\\xa0 al. 2004; Kumar and Ladha 2011). \\nTraditionally under rainfed TPR areas, need of ponded water for customary practice \\nof puddling delays rice transplanting by 1–3 weeks (Ladha et\\xa0al. 2009) resulting in \\nreduced yields. The puddled TPR production systems need a large quantity of water \\nand labor, which are becoming scarce and costly, in addition to the drudgery to \\ntransplanting women and children. The profit margins were also reduced due to \\nincreasing water and labor cost for TPR (Pandey and Velasco 1999). Hence, a major \\nshift from puddled TPR production system to DSR system is taking place in the \\nFig. 8.6\\u2002 (a) The drum seeder and (b) the crop of wet-seeded rice (left) sown by using the drum \\nseeder (Photos by A.N.\\xa0Rao)\\n8\\u2003 Rice Production Systems\\n194\\nirrigated areas of many developing countries in Asia (Pandey and Velasco 2005 , \\nRao et\\xa0al. 2007). However, compared to TPR, lower yield was reported with wet- \\nand dry-DSR production systems due to uneven or poor crop establishment; inade-\\nquate weed control; higher spikelet sterility than in puddled transplanting; higher \\ncrop lodging, especially in wet seeding and broadcasting; and micronutrient defi-\\nciencies (Rickman et\\xa0al. 2001; Rao et\\xa0al. 2007; Choudhury et\\xa0al. 2007; Singh et\\xa0al. \\n2005). Higher rice productivity was reported when these constraints were alleviated \\n(Bhushan et\\xa0al. 2007; Yoshinaga 2005).\\nThe performance of different types of DSR production systems varied with \\ncountries depending on the cultural practices used, the environment, and their inter-\\naction (Kumar and Ladha 2011). Among DSR production systems, line/drill seed-\\ning (compared with broadcasting) and wet-DSR (compared with dry-DSR) were \\nreported to yield higher. However, dry-DSR was found to be more resistant to \\ndrought with longer survival under drought period and may increase yield stability \\nof rainfed rice than the wet-DSR and transplanted rice systems (Boling et\\xa0al. 1998). \\nThe yield of dry-DSR and TPR systems were similar when irrigation was scheduled \\ndaily or at 20\\xa0kPa (Yadav et\\xa0al. 2011a). In China, a meta-analysis revealed that the \\nrice grain yield decreased in rice–rice cropping system and increased in rice-upland \\ncropping system due to the adoption of zero tillage (ZT) (Huang et\\xa0al. 2015), when \\ncompared to conventional tillage (CT). The responses of rice grain yield to ZT did \\nnot differ with rice establishment method (TPR or DSR), rice cultivar type (hybrid \\nor inbred), ZT adoption duration (<3\\xa0years or 3–6\\xa0years or >6\\xa0years), and manage-\\nment of crop residues (residues removed or retained) (Huang et\\xa0al. 2015).\\nBased on the data of several studies they reviewed, Kumar and Ladha (2011) \\nreported that direct-seeded rice production systems had a lower cost of production \\nby US$ 22–80\\xa0ha−1 resulting in higher economic returns of US$30–50\\xa0ha−1compared \\nwith conventional puddled TPR production system. They reported the savings in \\nproduction costs increased in the following order: ZT-dry-DSR > Bed-dry-DSR \\n>CT-dry-DSR > CT-wet-DSR > CT-TPR.\\n8.4\\u2003 \\x07Resource Use of\\xa0Different Rice Production Systems\\nHigh cost of production and diminishing resources have led to a greater focus on \\nimproving the overall eco-efficiencies of agricultural systems (Keating et\\xa0al. 2010) \\nfor achieving optimal agricultural outputs using less land, water, nutrients, energy, \\nlabor, and capital inputs in rice production systems.\\n8.4.1\\u2003 \\x07Water\\nIrrigated lowland rice is typically grown under flooded conditions, and at the field \\nlevel, it utilizes up to two to three times more water than other major food crops, due \\nto the unproductive water flows, in the form of seepage and percolation to drains, \\nA.N. Rao et al.\\n195\\ncreeks, or groundwater. This can amount to 60–80\\xa0% of all water inputs to rice \\n(Tabbal et\\xa0al. 2002). The water input for a typical puddled TPR per season was esti-\\nmated to vary from 660 to 5280\\xa0mm depending on the growing season, climatic \\nconditions, soil type, and hydrological conditions, with 1000–2000\\xa0mm as a typical \\nvalue in most cases (Tuong and Bouman 2003). The overexploitation of groundwa-\\nter to meet the high water requirement of TPR and water scarcity has become a \\nmajor threat to the sustainability of rice production (Rijsberman 2006). The per \\ncapita availability of water is expected to decline by 15–54\\xa0% over the next 35\\xa0years \\nin several countries of Asia (Gleick 1993), and by 2025, 15–20 million ha of rice \\nlands will suffer some degree of water scarcity (GriSP 2013). Hence, increasing \\nwater use efficiency in rice production systems is essential (Ladha et\\xa0al. 2015). In \\naddition to the consumption of large amount of irrigation water and labor, the pro-\\ncess of puddling results in subsurface compaction (Kukal and Aggarwal 2003).\\nThe increasing shortage of water resources has led to the development and adop-\\ntion of aerobic rice system, which saves water input and increases water productiv-\\nity by reducing water use during land preparation and limiting seepage, percolation, \\nand evaporation (Nie et\\xa0al. 2012). In an aerobic rice system, the crop can be dry \\ndirect-seeded or transplanted and soils are kept aerobic through the major part of the \\ngrowing season. Supplemental irrigation is applied when needed. Aerobic rice cul-\\ntivars are adapted to aerobic soils and have higher yield potential than traditional \\nupland cultivars. Grain yields of 5–6\\xa0t ha-1 can be reached in aerobic rice system \\n(Nie et\\xa0al. 2012).The micronutrient deficiencies such as Zn and Fe in aerobic rice \\nare of major concern (Gao et\\xa0al. 2006). Aerobic rice could considerably improve \\neco-efficiency in rice-based systems where water, labor, and energy are becoming \\nincreasingly scarce, and hence it is gaining importance in South Asia as an alterna-\\ntive to the conventional transplanted flooded rice system (Mahajan et\\xa0al. 2013).\\nDry-DSR production system helps to save irrigation water, especially in fine-\\xad\\ntextured soils (Yadav et\\xa0al. 2011a, b). Dry-DSR with intermittent irrigation offers \\npotential water savings at the field level due to reduced evaporation losses, intermit-\\ntent irrigation, and avoidance of puddling. In dry-DSR and TPR production sys-\\ntems, significant irrigation water input decline was recorded with irrigation at \\n20\\xa0kPa compared to daily irrigation (Yadav et\\xa0al. 2011a). Novel irrigation water-\\xad\\nsaving technologies such as alternate wetting and drying (AWD) can also help many \\nrice farmers around the world to cope with water scarcity (Lampayan et\\xa0al. 2015). \\nIn AWD, irrigation is given at intervals of 6–8\\xa0days for heavy soils and 4–5\\xa0days for \\nlighter soils. Prior to next irrigation, the soil dries naturally after the water disap-\\npearance from soil surface and the water quantity applied at each of the irrigation is \\nabout 50–60\\xa0mm. Thus, the introduction of aerobic periods during the growing sea-\\nson and altering soil chemistry and flooding practices results in reduced water use \\n(Yao et\\xa0al. 2012; Liu et\\xa0al. 2013) and reduced global warming potential (GWP) of \\ngreenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes (Feng et\\xa0al. 2013). A 10–77\\xa0% saving in water and \\n20–87\\xa0% increase in rice yield with the additional advantages of energy saving, \\nnutrient use efficiencies, and controlling vectors of malaria and Japanese encephali-\\ntis were reported with the use of AWD (Van der Hoek et\\xa0al. 2001). The irrigation at \\n20\\xa0kPa lowered the irrigation water use of dry-DSR, with AWD, by 33–53\\xa0% as \\ncompared to the respective transplanted rice system (Yadav et\\xa0al., 2011a).\\n8\\u2003 Rice Production Systems\\n196\\n8.4.2\\u2003 \\x07Nutrients\\nOf all the nutrients, nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P2O5), and potassium (K2O) \\nremain the major nutrients for increased and sustained rice productivity. The \\nfertilizer use trend in rice indicates the highest consumptions of N fertilizer fol-\\nlowed by P2O5 and K2O fertilizers with imbalanced fertilizer use (i.e., very high \\nuse of N, less use of P2O5, and negligible use of K2O, S, and micronutrients), \\nincreased soil nutrient mining, and decreased soil organic matter and soil fertility \\n(FAO 2006). Proper nutrient management should aim to supply fertilizers ade-\\nquate for the demand of the rice and applied in ways that minimize loss, maxi-\\nmize the efficiency of use, and improve the productivity and sustainability of rice \\nproduction systems, because of the high potential for loss and economic and \\nenvironmental consequences (Chien et\\xa0al. 2009). The nutrient management strat-\\negies for irrigated and rainfed lowland rice production systems vary (Dobermann \\nand White 1999).\\nAmong macronutrients, N is a key nutrient for the optimal rice growth and devel-\\nopment to attain optimal rice yield. The rice crop and water management practices \\nfor DSR differ considerably from those for TPR.\\xa0The DSR may have higher nitro-\\ngen requirement due to the longer duration of DSR in fields than puddle trans-\\nplanted rice (Kumar and Ladha 2011).The insufficient N uptake by the DSR crop \\nand resulting lower yield observed in DSR production systems (Kropff et\\xa0al. 1994) \\nwas reported to be due to relatively lower uptake of nitrogen by the shallower roots \\nof DSR (Zhang and Wang 2002) and higher leaching losses of applied nitrogen out \\nof root zone in DSR (Ponnamperuma 1972). Increasing nitrogen quantity in DSR in \\nlarger number of splits with optimum irrigation may lead to higher rice yield due to \\ntheir effect on the nitrogen movement and availability to plants in soils especially in \\ncoarse- and medium-textured soils (Shad and De Datta 1988).\\nN is applied in the larger quantities compared to all other nutrients as most soils \\nof rice production systems are nitrogen deficient. As per global estimates, the fer-\\ntilizer N recovery by the crop averages only 46\\xa0% in rice systems (Ladha et\\xa0al. \\n2005). To increase the N use efficiency of irrigated rice, site-specific N manage-\\nment (SSNM) was developed (Dobermann et\\xa0al. 2002), in which N application is \\nbased on the demand of the crop for N as measured by the chlorophyll meter \\n(SPAD) or leaf color chart (Peng et\\xa0al. 1996). The usefulness of leaf color chart for \\ndry-DSR rainfed lowland rice and wet-DSR was reported by Budhar and \\nTamilselvan (2003) and Angadi et\\xa0al. (2002). SSNM was evaluated in farmers’ \\nfields in eight major irrigated rice domains in Asia, and the average grain yield \\nincreased by 11\\xa0% with an increase in average recovery efficiency from 31\\xa0% to \\n40\\xa0 % and 20\\xa0 % of all farmers achieving more than 50\\xa0 % recovery efficiency \\n(Dobermann et\\xa0al. 2002). Enhanced efficiency nitrogen fertilizers have been devel-\\noped to decrease N losses and improve N use efficiency in rice production systems \\n(Linquist et\\xa0al. 2013).\\nOn an average, around 18\\xa0kg\\xa0ha−1 of K2O for the irrigated rice crop is needed \\n(Dobermann and Cassman 1997). K2O deficiency has become a constraint in soils \\nA.N. Rao et al.\\n197\\nthat were previously not considered as K2O limiting. The occurrence of K2O defi-\\nciency and response to applied K2O depend on the yield levels, K2O buffering \\ncapacity of the soil, straw management, and net K2O inputs from sources other than \\nfertilizer (Dobermann et\\xa0al. 1996). Clay mineralogy, texture, and K2O inputs from \\nirrigation or rainwater are needed to be considered along with K2O inputs from \\nother sources while formulating a rational K2O management strategy for the rice \\nproduction systems (Dobermann et\\xa0al. 1998).\\nIn the irrigated rice production systems, P2O5 solubilizes immediately after \\nflooding, leading to an increase in available P2O5 to rice (Kirk et\\xa0 al. 1990). \\nHowever, soil drying reduces its availability to crop (Willet and Higgens 1978; \\nSah et\\xa0 al. 1989). Hence, phosphorus deficiency is important in drought-prone \\nenvironments because the mobility of P2O5 decreases sharply as soil dries. In sys-\\ntems of low P2O5 fertility, the repeated dry-wet transition increases P2O5 extrac-\\ntion, further lowering fertility. The upland rice dry-DSR is generally grown on \\npoorly fertile, strongly weathered soil, with high P2O5 fixation and severe soil \\nacidity. P2O5 deficiency is one of the key constraints of upland dry-DSR produc-\\ntion (Gupta and O’Toole 1986). Banding of P2O5 fertilizer beneath the dry-DSR \\ncrop row is preferred.\\nThe deficiency of secondary and micronutrients is often stimulated by the appli-\\ncation of large amounts of N, P2O5, and K2O for achieving higher rice yield targets \\n(Johnston et\\xa0al. 2009). Iron (Fe) is only slightly soluble in the soil under aerobic \\nconditions, especially in alkaline calcareous soils (Marschner 1995). Fe deficiency \\nis a common nutritional problem in the production of aerobic rice. Current crop \\nmanagement strategies addressing Fe deficiency include Fe foliar application, plant \\nbreeding for enriched Fe rice varieties, and adoption of cropping systems (Zuo and \\nZhang 2011). Across the globe, among micronutrients, zinc (Zn) deficiency is one \\nof the important abiotic factors limiting rice productivity in addition to being a \\nmajor nutritional disorder affecting human health (Alloway 2009). Zn deficiency is \\nwide spread in traditional lowland (Dobermann and Fairhurst 2000) due to high soil \\npH and high carbonate content as well as low redox potential (Forno et\\xa0al. 1975; \\nAlloway 2009). Shifting the method of establishment from TPR to DSR or aerobic \\nrice system and adoption of water-saving technologies like AWD may decrease Zn \\navailability (Gao et\\xa0al. 2006). Soil or foliar Zn fertilizers application is used to man-\\nage Zn deficiency (Rengel et\\xa0al. 1999) and to increase grain Zn concentration (Jiang \\net\\xa0al. 2008). It is essential to utilize breeding programs to increase Zn uptake and \\nutilization in rice production systems as a large genotypic variation (13.5–\\n58.4\\xa0mg\\xa0kg–1) was recorded in Zn grain concentration with differential rice \\xadgenotypic \\nresponses to Zn deficiency (Graham et\\xa0al. 1999; Quijano-Guerta et\\xa0al. 2002; Shi \\net\\xa0al. 2009; Gao et\\xa0al. 2009).\\nIt is essential to have a proper blend of organic and inorganic fertilizers for \\nincreasing the productivity of rice production systems and for improving soil health. \\nApplication of SSNM can help improve nutrient management in rice production \\nsystems and attain improved yields and profitability as SSNM is based on scientific \\nprinciples for optimal site-specific and need-based supply of nutrients to rice in a \\nparticular cropping season.\\n8\\u2003 Rice Production Systems\\n198\\n8.5\\u2003 \\x07Pests (Insects, Diseases, and\\xa0Weeds) and\\xa0Their \\nManagement in\\xa0Different Rice Production Systems\\nThe estimated average potential yield loss in major crops globally is 18\\xa0%, 16\\xa0%, \\nand 34\\xa0% due to animal pests, (non-virus) pathogens, and weeds, respectively, in the \\nabsence of any physical, biological, or chemical crop protection (Oerke 2006). The \\npotentially highest yield loss causing weeds are more problematic in the DSR pro-\\nduction system than in puddled TPR production system. The young emerging rice \\nseedlings of DSR do not possess a competitive advantage over weeds as do have the \\ntransplanted 30-day-old seedlings in the TPR.\\xa0Moreover, a layer of water suppresses \\nthe initial flushes of weeds in TPR, and lack of flooding in DSR provides a competi-\\ntive advantage to weeds over rice seedlings in DSR (Rao et\\xa0 al. 2007, Rao and \\nNagamani 2007). In addition to currently problematic weeds such Echinochloa \\nspp., weedy rice is becoming a major threat to dry-DSR production systems which \\nreplaced traditional transplanted rice production systems (Rao and Nagamani 2007). \\nHence, integrated weed management strategies are to be developed for managing \\nthe weedy-rice problem in dry-DSR production systems.\\nA study in tropical Asia covering a wide range of lowland rice-cultivating envi-\\nronments revealed that the injury profiles were dominated by stem rot and sheath \\nblight; bacterial leaf blight, plant hoppers, and leaf folder; and sheath rot, brown \\nspot, leaf blast, and neck blast (Savary et\\xa0al. 2000). Stem rot and sheath blight were \\nassociated with high (mineral) fertilizer inputs, long fallow periods, low pesticide \\nuse, and good water management in (mostly) transplanted rice crops of a rice–rice \\nrotation. Bacterial leaf blight, plant hoppers, and leaf folder were more prevalent in \\ndirect-seeded rice–rice production system with poor water management and lower \\nfertilizer and pesticide input use or with adequate water management and higher \\nfertilizer and pesticide input usage. Sheath rot, brown spot, leaf blast, and neck blast \\ncorrespond to low-input, labor-intensive (hand weeding and transplanting) rice \\ncrops in a diverse rotation system with uncertain water supply. Weed infestation is \\nan omnipresent constraint. The high weed pressure, severe iron deficiency, and \\nnematode infestation coupled with higher irrigation water inputs were reported to \\nbe the reasons for getting rice yields lower than the transplanted rice by the adoption \\nof dry-seeded rice with most frequent irrigations on coarse- and medium-textured \\nsoils (Singh et\\xa0al. 2015).\\nThe rice production systems were reported to differ in the incidence and losses \\ncaused due to the pests. A Korean study revealed higher population densities of \\ngreen rice leafhopper (Nephotettix cincticeps) and leaf folders (Cnaphalocrocis \\nmedinalis) in machine-transplanted than in direct-seeded rice, while abundance of \\nbrown plant hopper (Nilaparvata lugens) and small brown plant hopper (Laodelphax \\nstriatellus) was more in dry-DSR (Lee and Ma 1997). However, incidence of the \\nAsiatic rice borer or striped rice stem borer (Chilo suppressalis), white-backed plant \\nhopper (WBPH) (Sogatella furcifera), and rice stem maggot (Chlorops oryzae) did \\nnot differ among machine-transplanted and direct-seeded rice production systems \\n(Lee and Ma 1997). In Punjab (India), the leaf folder incidence was higher in the \\nA.N. Rao et al.\\n199\\nbed-transplanted (BT) (8.87\\xa0%) and wet-seeded rice (WSR) (10.62\\xa0%) than that in \\nrice grown using the other crop establishment methods (Sarao and Mahal 2013). \\nThe incidence of stem borer causing dead heart damage was significantly higher in \\nthe WSR system (5.85\\xa0%), while that of whitehead damage was higher in the BT \\n(5.89\\xa0%) and WSR (6.54\\xa0%) plots than in other rice production systems. In Korea, \\nsheath blight (Rhizoctonia solani) incidence was not affected by different rice pro-\\nduction systems, while the incidence of rice blast (Magnaporthe grisea) was \\naffected and favored by unbalanced nutrient contents in the rice plants (especially \\nlow SiO2 and high nitrogen) and high leaf area index (LAI) (Kim et\\xa0al.1996).\\nIntegrated weed management strategies are available for managing weeds of dif-\\nferent rice production systems (Rao 2010; Rao and Ladha 2011, 2013; Rao and \\nNagamani 2007, 2010; Rao et\\xa0al. 2007, 2015). The management aspects of the dis-\\neases and insect pests of rice are dealt with in other chapters of this book.\\n8.6\\u2003 \\x07Environmental Footprint by\\xa0Different Rice Production \\nSystems\\nAmong different sectors that contribute to total greenhouse gas emissions of the \\nworld, contribution of agriculture is around 9.3\\xa0%, including 1.5\\xa0% of rice. Emissions \\nof greenhouse gases (GHGs) from rice fields are common in South, East, and \\nSoutheast Asia. Rice ecosystems emit both CH4 and N2O and have higher global \\nwarming potential (GWP) of GHG emissions and have higher GWPY (GWP per \\nunit of yield) than other crops as rice is grown usually under flooded conditions in \\nirrigated ecosystems and uses more water (Linquist et\\xa0al. 2012).\\nDue to individual or combined effects of various factors such as soil characteris-\\ntics, climatic conditions, and management such as soil pH, redox potential, soil \\ntexture, soil salinity, temperature, rainfall, and water management, amount of CH4 \\nemission varies between different rice production systems depending on the rice \\nestablishment techniques (Harada et\\xa0al. 2007; Ladha et\\xa0al. 2015). The irrigated pud-\\ndled TPR is considered one of the major sources of methane (CH4) emissions and \\naccounts for 10–20\\xa0% (50–100 Tg year −1) of total global annual CH4 emissions \\n(Reiner and Aulakh 2000). Direct seeding has the potential to decrease CH4 emis-\\nsions (Wassmann et\\xa0al. 2004). CH4 emissions were reported to be lower in DSR than \\nwith conventional TPR (Gupta et\\xa0al. 2002; Tyagi et\\xa0al. 2010). In wet-DSR, the \\nreduction in CH4 emission increased from 16–22\\xa0% under continuous flooding to \\n82–92\\xa0% under mid-season drainage or intermittent irrigation as compared with \\nconventional TPR under continuous flooding (Corton et\\xa0al. 2000). CH4 gas emission \\nand global warming potential were maximum under conventional TPR, and emis-\\nsion of N2O was maximum under DSR crop with conservation practice of brown \\nmanuring as the addition of organic matter to soil increased the decomposition rate, \\nwhich resulted in higher emission of GHGs (Bhatia et\\xa0al. 2011). One of the ways, to \\nminimize CH4 emissions while attaining equivalent or higher rice yield and lower \\nirrigation water use than those of farmer-managed puddled TPR, is adoption of dry-\\xad\\n8\\u2003 Rice Production Systems\\n200\\nDSR with best management practices and conservation agriculture (CA) that uses \\nZT or minimum till while retaining rotational crop residues (Ladha et\\xa0al. 2015). \\nIzaurralde et\\xa0al. (2004) opined that soils under ZT, depending on the management, \\nmight also emit less nitrous oxide.\\n8.7\\u2003 \\x07Challenges and\\xa0Future Research Needs of\\xa0Different Rice \\nProduction Systems\\nThe challenges vary with the rice production systems. The main factors that limit \\nthe yield in irrigated areas include poor management of inputs and resources; \\nlosses from weeds, pests, and diseases; inadequate land and water scarcity; and \\nresulting salinity and alkalinity. In rainfed lowlands the challenges include adverse \\nclimate, drought, submergence, poor soils, pests, weeds, and absence of appropri-\\nate soil, water, crop management technologies, or strategies to suit the farmers’ \\nneeds and which economically increase rice productivity. In upland dry-DSR \\nenvironment, the major challenges are the biological constraints such as weeds, \\nnematodes, and diseases (e.g., blast), poor soil fertility, socioeconomic con-\\nstraints, and lack of productive varieties to suit the microenvironment of uplands \\nand the drought. In TPR production systems, inappropriate management of prob-\\nlem soils, non-judicious use of fertilizers and water, and resulting pest prolifera-\\ntions and increasing cost of cultivation are major challenges. In aerobic rice \\nproduction systems, lack of fine-tuned need-based technologies suited to different \\nrice ecosystems across globe, non-\\xadavailability of suitable varieties, micronutrient \\ndeficiencies, soil and water management optimization, adaptive weed menace, \\nand pest problems are major challenges.\\nThe future research efforts on rice production systems should ultimately result in \\n(i) evolving practical integrated crop management strategies that improve rice pro-\\nductivity and production efficiently, effectively, and economically in different rice \\nproduction systems across the globe and (ii) improving the food security and \\n\\xadlivelihood of the farmers and farming community of rice and rice-based cropping \\nsystems globally.\\nAcknowledgments\\u2002 Authors thank IRRI, whose figures are used.
